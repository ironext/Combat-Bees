# Getting started

The Hybrid Renderer package contains two versions of Hybrid Renderer. Depending on which version of Hybrid Render you want to use, and which render pipeline you want to use it with, the steps to get started differ.

- For information about the different versions, see [Hybrid Renderer versions](hybrid-renderer-versions.md).
- For information about which versions support which render pipeline and Unity versions, see [Requirements and compatibility](requirements-and-compatibility.md).

When you know which version of Hybrid Renderer you want to use and which render pipeline you want to use it with, see [Installing Hybrid Renderer](creating-a-new-hybrid-renderer-project.md) for information on how to create and set up your project.
